## How did you come up with your idea?

I came up with this idea because it is a project that I have been thinking about for quite some time. When I transferred to Babson, I was surprised that there is no common marketplace for students to sell their items. As a college where a lot of students move to study abroad and work, there should be a platform that promotes a sustainable lifestyle and helps sellers gain some financial returns. 

## How well did the collaboration with your developer work?

Andrew was really easy to work with. He created a well-rounded website that followed my instructions closely. He also added features that I had not thought of. For example, he programmed the website in a way where it was actually possible to post items and view their description when they were clicked on. 

## What did you learn about writing requirements?

I learned about the writing requirements that providing feedback is a delicate balance between appreciating all of the hard work the developer has put in, and the suggestions you want to provide. I felt bad when Andrew would make an incredible change, and I would give him another task to complete. Overall, Andrew was a really good teammate and developer. He was really understanding.

## Did you use any AI tools in this process? How?

During this process I did not use any AI tools. Since Babson Marketplace had been an idea of mine since a year ago, I had time to think about how I wanted it to look.
